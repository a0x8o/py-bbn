# PyBBN

PyBBN is Python library for Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) exact inference using the 
[junction tree algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_tree_algorithm) or Probability
Propagation in Trees of Clusters. The implementation is taken directly from [C. Huang and A. Darwiche, "Inference in
Belief Networks: A Procedural Guide," in International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, vol. 15,
pp. 225--263, 1999](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dpage/ijar95.pdf).
